# About the project:  
### Background:  
A disaster is an unexpected incident that takes place in an area, causing damage to physical assets and lives of people living there. 
Emergency Operation Center (EOC) is a center that works to mitigate the disasters that occur across a county region. Each county will have
its own EOC and access to other region EOCâ€™s information with the help of Common Operating Picture (COP). 
Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) visits the disaster affected area and send information to the EOC. Upon receiving the information 
from CERT teams about the situation of a disaster, the EOC will send the required emergency teams like Fire team, Law & Police and 
the Medical team to the location.   
  
### Application:
This project involves two different applications: a web application and a mobile application. Web application will be accessed by the EOC
to perform opertions like sending notifications to the CERT teams about the disaster, collecting and reviewing the reports sent by the CERT 
team about the disasters and keeping the track of armed forces/emergency response teams. Mobile application will be accessed by the CERT 
team members to perform operations like mobile application signup, login, submit cert application form to join cert teams, receiving 
notificaitons about disaster and sending of disaster report after visit.
